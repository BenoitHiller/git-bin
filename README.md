My collection of custom git scripts for performing actions that are more complex than what you would want to put in an alias.

## Scripts

* `git-sed` run a `sed` command on every file in the current repository modifying them in-place.
* `git-vsed` same idea as `git-vsed` but use `vim` to do the replacements with confirmation.
* `git-xargs` run a command on every file in a git repository with filtering options based on pathspec and content.
